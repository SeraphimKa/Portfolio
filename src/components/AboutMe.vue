            <h3>A passionate Front-End Developer based in Athens, Greece.</h3>
            <p>As a Junior Front-End Web developer I have built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Primarilly have been working with the Vue framework, alongside Tailwind CSS which allow for better and
                faster
                development. I'm
                eager
                to bring my skills to the forefront of creating dynamic and user-friendly web experiences. I love the
                creative
                process of turning ideas into functional and visually appealing websites, and bringing them to life. I'm
                always
                excited to learn and apply new technologies. I always was a collaborative team player and I thrive in a
                fast-paced
                environment where I can contribute to building innovative solutions that make a real impact. My goal is to
                continuously grow as a developer, delivering top-notch projects that not only meet but exceed expectations.
                Let's
            create something remarkable together! </p>
