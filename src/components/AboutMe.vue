            <h3>Passionate Front End Developer based in Athens, Greece</h3>
            <p>As a Junior Front-End Web developer I have built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Primarilly have been working with the Vue framework alongside Tailwind. I'm
                eager
                to bring my skills to the forefront of creating dynamic and user-friendly web experiences. I love the
                creative
                process of turning ideas into functional and visually appealing websites and bringing them to life. I'm
                always
                excited to learn and apply new technologies. I always was a collaborative team player and I thrive in an
                environment where I can contribute innovative solutions that make a real impact. As I
                continuously grow as a developer, my goal is to delivering top-notch projects that not only meet but exceed
                expectations! </p>
